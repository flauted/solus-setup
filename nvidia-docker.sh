# Solus 3.9.9.9, Nvidia driver 390.48 with GTX 1080.
# No CUDA, Cudnn, etc. in native env.
#
# Full disclosure
# ---------------
# Cuda 9.1 WITHOUT compiler in a NON-ACTIVE conda env
# Tried to accomplish this install yesterday. Don't BELIEVE anything I did interacted, but...
#
# Overview of task
# ----------------
# Install nvidia-docker2 on Solus; Docker was pre-installed. That left the task of
# getting nvidia-container-runtime and registering. This was partially constructed from the base/Dockerfile's,
# the hook/Dockerfile's, the runtime/Dockerfile's, and adzy2k6's instructions on
# nvidia-container-runtime issue #9.
#
# You'll be downloading runc source (the 'normal' docker runtime), downloading nvidia-container-runtime,
# applying an nvidia-enabling patch from ncr to runc, and building hooked runc with Go. Then you'll copy
# the 'new runc' and the hook into an execable location (/usr/bin). After that, you'll need
# to build libnvidia-container. We'll build that in an Ubuntu docker image and copy the produced lib out to
# usr/lib. Finally, we'll register the new runtime with the docker daemon and restart the daemon.
#
# Warning
# -------
# As the author of these instructions, I wouldn't run them again as a script. Some things were re-arranged
# in retrospect and never tested! I also did some things that I wouldn't appreciate a script doing on my 
# system (namely, making a dir directly under / and changing the owner).


# Already had these three installed. You'll definitely need git and golang. In retrospect, not
# sure you'll need wget.

# You'll need to register the docker runtime and restart the docker daemon. That should be simple
# unless you're trying to do all this in a container. Then you wouldn't have access to
# the daemon. Just a note from experience doing other things inside containers.
#
# From the container runtime README, configure the systemd file AND NOT the daemon json (the json will work until you go to reboot. Then you'll have to sudo dockerd on startup.)
# Register new runtime:
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf <<EOF
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --host=fd:// --add-runtime=nvidia=/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime
EOF
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker

# Enjoy! :D
docker run --runtime=nvidia nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi

# After reboot, I had to run
# sudo dockerd 2>/dev/null &
# That's a symptom that you've used the daemon.json instead of the systemd.
# Just rm the daemon.json file (or mv it).
#
# Lastly verify that
docker run hello-world
# still works. If it doesn't, there's a good chance you accidentally overwrote
# /usr/bin/runc. That's not a big deal, just do:
# eopkg rmf docker
# eopkg it docker
# That'll remove runc and reinstall it. Now, if you accidentally put AND LEFT
# something at /usr/bin/runc... :(
